# Pong-Game
A simple implementation of the classic PONG game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

# Introduction
This Python script implements the PONG game, where two paddles and a ball bounce within the game window. The player-controlled paddles aim to prevent the ball from passing them, and each miss results in a point for the opposing player.

# Features
Paddle Movement: Two paddles, one on the left and one on the right, controlled by separate keys.
Ball Movement: A bouncing ball that moves between the paddles.
Scoreboard: Keeps track of each player's score.
