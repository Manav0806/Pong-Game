# Pong-Game
A simple implementation of the classic PONG game using Python's Turtle graphics library.

# Introduction
This project implements a classic PONG game in Python, where two players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. Each missed hit results in a point for the opponent.

# Features
1. Paddle Movement: Two paddles, one on each side, controlled by separate keys.
2. Ball Movement: A bouncing ball that changes direction on collision with walls or paddles.
3. Scoreboard: Keeps track of each player's score.
4.Simple User Interface: Black background with white paddle and ball elements.

# Game Controls:

  # Right Paddle:
      Move Up: "Up" arrow key
      Move Down: "Down" arrow key
  # Left Paddle:
      Move Up: "w" key
      Move Down: "s" key

# Additional Notes:

1. You can customize the game window size and background color by modifying the script.
2. Consider adding features like power-ups, sound effects, or difficulty levels to enhance the gameplay.
3. Check out the `paddle.py`, `ball.py`, and `scoreboard.py` files for the implementation details of these classes.
